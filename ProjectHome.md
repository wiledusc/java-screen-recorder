java-screen-recorder provides platform independent screen capture and playback, producing high quality screen recordings using an internal lossless compression algorithm. The recordings can be played back with the included screen player application, or optionally converted to the QT movie format, using the included screen converter application.

The output video can be post-processed to other formats, using a video conversion tool such as ffmpeg.

The screen recorder, player and converter tools are all self contained jar files, requiring only the Java Runtime Environment for execution. These tools operate independently of any other external software codecs and libraries, to provide true platform independent video capture.
